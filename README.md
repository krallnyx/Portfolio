# Arnaud's Portfolio

Portfolio I did for myself, I wanted it light and easy to read (recruiters have very limited time...)

## Goal
The goal of this project was to make a 3 pages website, showcasing some of the projects I've worked on, part of my CV and a contact form
I also wanted to be able to re-route a wrong URL to an error page

### Part 1: Landing page
* On the webpage, according to an initial mockup, I wanted a clean display, responsive and show a few project
* I've choosen to use Bootstrap's cards and the usual bootstrap navbar

### Part 2: CV page
* This part was all about making it responsive and usable on a mobile device without making it dirty
* Bootstrap helped again, I didn't used FontAwesome for the icons, I liked those ones better.

### Part 3: Contact form
* This form may never been used but it's working and every way to contact me is good to have :)


## Theme
The whole design of the website is based on my idea of a minimalistic design, low in colours to be effective


## Technologies
I used the following technologies:
* HTML 5 / CSS 3 with Bootstrap
* React (with React-Router)
* jQuery (for Bootstrap)

## How to run it

In order to run it, simply launch the command "npm install" on the root folder then "npm start", it will open the page on localhost:3000

## Live limk

The webiste is not currently hosted anywhere (as far as I know !)
